    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p id="main">Understanding how purchase behavior is influenced by various factors such as location, promotions, demographics, and loyalty is crucial for businesses aiming to optimize their marketing and sales strategies. Our analysis seeks to examine how these elements impact both the frequency of purchases and the size of baskets, providing insights into consumer decision-making processes. By examining these factors, we can glean insights into how businesses can tailor their approaches to better meet the needs and preferences of their target audience, in order to drive sales and increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. Succinctly, the question weâ€™re looking to examine is: How is purchase behavior (frequency and basket size) impacted by buyer location, promotions, demographics, and loyalty?</p>
