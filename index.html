			Understanding how purchase behavior is influenced by various factors
			such as location, promotions, demographics, and loyalty is crucial
			for businesses aiming to optimize their marketing and sales
			strategies. Our analysis seeks to examine how these elements impact
			both the frequency of purchases and the size of baskets, providing
			insights into consumer decision-making processes. By examining these
			factors, we can glean insights into how businesses can tailor their
			approaches to better meet the needs and preferences of their target
			audience, in order to drive sales and increase customer satisfaction
			and loyalty. Succinctly, the question weâ€™re looking to examine is:
			How is purchase behavior (frequency and basket size) impacted by
			buyer location, promotions, demographics, and loyalty?

			This chart shows the items purchased by season, where each item is
			colored by category. The viewer is able to switch between seasons or
			view them in the aggregate in order to drill down onto more specific
			data. This stacked bar chart shows that generally, clothing are the
			highest purchased items, making up four out of the five most
			purchased items across all seasons. As one would expect, the
			outerwear category sees higher sales in the Fall and Winter compared
			to the summer and fall. That being said, the dataset also comes with
			some key surprises. For instance, Pants are the leading item in the
			summer, and skirt is one of the lowest selling items of the summer.
			This is potentially due to people planning their shopping ahead
			(buying pants for the fall because they already bought skirts in the
			spring, which is corroborated in the data.)

		<h3>Figure 7: Relationship between Gender and Purchases</h3>

		<p>
			For store owners, knowing the demographics for shopping behaviors
			and trends are important in order to target consumers for online and
			physical advertising. The chart shows the sales total purchase
			amounts for the primary genders, divided into the purchase
			categories. It can be seen that males spend nearly double overall
			than females, outspending them in every product category. However,
			for both males and females, the relative spending per category is
			the same, ie clothing is the largest category, followed by
			accessories, footwear, then outerwear. This suggests that males
			spend more overall when shopping, with the largest product category
			being clothing.
