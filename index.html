			Demographics, and Loyalty

		<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
		<p id="main">
			Understanding how purchase behavior is influenced by various factors
			such as location, promotions, demographics, and loyalty is crucial
			for businesses aiming to optimize their marketing and sales
			strategies. Our analysis seeks to examine how these elements impact
			both the frequency of purchases and the size of baskets, providing
			insights into consumer decision-making processes. By examining these
			factors, we can glean insights into how businesses can tailor their
			approaches to better meet the needs and preferences of their target
			audience, in order to drive sales and increase customer satisfaction
			and loyalty. Succinctly, the question weâ€™re looking to examine is:
			How is purchase behavior (frequency and basket size) impacted by
			buyer location, promotions, demographics, and loyalty?

		<!-- Descriptive Static Graphs Section -->
		<h3 id="descriptive-graphs">Initial Observations</h3>

		<h4>
			Figure 1: Distribution of Consumer Preferences by Product Category
		</h4>
		<iframe
			src="consumer_preferences_category.jpg"
			alt="Consumer Preferences Distribution"
			width="850"
			height="600"
			style="border: none"
		></iframe>
		<p>Description of the figure: <em>This figure is a bar chart of the most preferred categories by shoppers. The figure shows the distribution of most commonly purchased categories across the whole dataset. Clothing is the most popular category while outerwear is the least populat category.</em></p>

		<h4>Figure 2: </h4>
		<iframe
			src="Distribution_of_Age.jpg"
			alt="Distribution of Purchasers by Age"
			width="850"
			height="600"
			style="border: none"
		></iframe>
		<p><em>Description of the figure:</em></p>

		<h4>Figure 3: Impact of Promotions on Buying Behavior</h4>
		<img
			src="Distribution of Purchase Amount.jpg"
			alt="Impact of Promotions on Buying Behavior"
			width="850"
		/>
		<p><em>Description of the figure:</em></p>

		<h4>Figure 4: Impact of Promotions on Buying Behavior</h4>
		<iframe
			src="items_by_season.html"
			width="850"
			height="600"
			style="border: none"
		></iframe>
		<p>This chart shows the items purchased by season, where each item is colored
			 by category. The viewer is able to switch between seasons or view them 
			 in the aggregate in order to drill down onto more specific data. This 
			 stacked bar chart shows that generally, clothing are the highest 
			 purchased items, making up four out of the five most purchased items 
			 across all seasons. As one would expect, the outerwear category sees 
			 higher sales in the Fall and Winter compared to the summer and fall. 
			 That being said, the dataset also comes with some key surprises. For 
			 instance, Pants are the leading item in the summer, and skirt is one 
			 of the lowest selling items of the summer. This is potentially due to 
			 people planning their shopping ahead (buying pants for the fall because 
			 they already bought skirts in the spring, which is corroborated in the data.)
		</p>

		<h3>Figure 5: Relationship between Demographics and Purchases</h3>
		<iframe
			src="h.html"
			width="800"
			height="450"
			style="border: none"
		></iframe>
		<p>
			For store owners, knowing the demographics for shopping behaviors
			and trends are important in order to target consumers for online and
			physical advertising. The chart shows the sales total purchase
			amounts for the primary genders, divided into the purchase
			categories. It can be seen that males spend nearly double overall
			than females, outspending them in every product category. However,
			for both males and females, the relative spending per category is
			the same, ie clothing is the largest category, followed by
			accessories, footwear, then outerwear. This suggests that males
			spend more overall when shopping, with the largest product category
			being clothing.
