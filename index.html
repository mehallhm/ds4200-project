		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
		<p id="main">
			Understanding how purchase behavior is influenced by various factors
			such as location, promotions, demographics, and loyalty is crucial
			for businesses aiming to optimize their marketing and sales
			strategies. Our analysis seeks to examine how these elements impact
			both the frequency of purchases and the size of baskets, providing
			insights into consumer decision-making processes. By examining these
			factors, we can glean insights into how businesses can tailor their
			approaches to better meet the needs and preferences of their target
			audience, in order to drive sales and increase customer satisfaction
			and loyalty. Succinctly, the question we’re looking to examine is:
			How is purchase behavior (frequency and basket size) impacted by
			buyer location, promotions, demographics, and loyalty?
		</p>

		<h2 id="data-sources">Our Data</h2>
		<p>
			The dataset is from Kaggle originally composed by Sir Sourav
			Banerjee at CogniTensor and last updated a year ago. It contains two
			tables covering demographic information, purchase history, product
			preference, and preferred shopping channels with the first table
			focusing on customer behavior while the second on customer trends.
			Both contain about 3900 observations across 18 columns, including
			both categorical (such as gender, size, season) and continuous
			variables (purchase amount, age). Data is licensed under Creative
			Commons and thus is free to use.
		</p>

				small parabolic trend, where more purchases occur at lower
				basket sizes ($20-$40), and higher basket sizes ($85+), while
				baskets in the middle occur with less frequency. This informs us
				that customers are often making large or small purchases,
				putting one or two things in their cart, or many.

		<h3>Figure 4: Items Purchased By Season</h3>
		<iframe
			src="items_by_season.html"
			width="850"
			height="500"
			style="border: none"
		></iframe>
		<p>
			This chart shows the items purchased by season, where each item is
			colored by category. The viewer is able to switch between seasons or
			view them in the aggregate in order to drill down onto more specific
			data. This stacked bar chart shows that generally, clothing are the
			highest purchased items, making up four out of the five most
			purchased items across all seasons. As one would expect, the
			outerwear category sees higher sales in the Fall and Winter compared
			to the summer and fall. That being said, the dataset also comes with
			some key surprises. For instance, Pants are the leading item in the
			summer, and skirt is one of the lowest selling items of the summer.
			This is potentially due to people planning their shopping ahead
			(buying pants for the fall because they already bought skirts in the
			spring, which is corroborated in the data.)
		</p>

		<h3>Figure 5: Relationship between Demographics and Purchases</h3>
		<iframe
			src="average_by_gender.html"
			width="1000"
			height="480"
			style="border: none"
		></iframe>
		<p>
			The chart on the left shows the average spending across all
			categories by gender. It can be seen that females spend on average
			more than males by about $1. However, when looking at the broken up
			bar chart on the right, the categories that females and males
			primarily spend on are different. While females spend the most on
			accessories, followed by clothing, footwear, and then finally
			outerwear, males spend the most in footwear, followed by clothing,
			accessories, and finally footwear. These differences can be observed
			by selecting either a section or bar of the charts to highlight just
			that category, or by selecting a gender by clicking on the grey
			square in the center legend. This allows for an easier comparison
			between categories in the same gender, or the same category.
		</p>
		<p>
			The conclusions of this chart illistrate that stores should focus on
			certain categories for each gender. For females accessories should
			be prioritized while males spend more on footwear. Outerwear is the
			least spent category for both, thus indicating that it should be
			minimized in comparison to the other categories.

		<p>
			This figure shows a choropleth map of the United States with states
			colored on the average spend. The hovering over each state reveals
			more information about the average spend as well as the frequecy of
			shopping.

		<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
		<p>
			This analysis of consumer buying behavior has provided valuable
			insights into the impact of key drivers such as location,
			promotions, demographics, and loyalty on both the frequency of
			purchases and basket size. By examining the dataset, we were able to
			identify several significant trends that can inform how businesses
			tailor their marketing strategies and optimize their sales
			processes.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Impact of Demographics on Consumer Behavior</strong></p>
		<p>
			The relationship between consumer demographics (such as gender and
			age) and purchase behavior was strikingly evident. Our analysis
			showed that while males tend to spend more overall, their spending
			patterns across categories are consistent with those of females,
			with clothing being the dominant category. This suggests that while
			demographic differences are important, the broad categories of
			interest remain similar across genders. Furthermore, we observed
			that younger consumers were underrepresented in the dataset, which
			could suggest that marketing efforts should be adjusted to better
			target this group through digital channels or tailored product
			offerings.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Role of Promotions in Shaping Purchase Behavior</strong></p>
		<p>
			Promotions played a significant role in influencing both the
			frequency of purchases and the size of baskets. The data
			demonstrated a parabolic trend, where a higher frequency of
			purchases occurred in lower and higher basket sizes, with fewer
			purchases made in the mid-range. This suggests that promotions can
			be highly effective in driving either low-cost, frequent impulse
			purchases or larger, more considered transactions. For retailers,
			understanding these patterns can help in designing promotions that
			align with consumer behavior, such as offering discounts for bulk
			purchases or strategically timed sales that encourage larger
			baskets.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Seasonal Trends and Product Preferences</strong></p>
		<p>
			Our exploration of seasonal trends revealed interesting dynamics in
			how product categories are purchased throughout the year. As
			expected, clothing remained the most consistently purchased item,
			with outerwear peaking in the colder months. However, the summer
			months saw an unexpected rise in pants sales, indicating that
			consumers may be purchasing for future seasons. This highlights the
			importance of anticipating consumer needs and adjusting inventory
			and marketing strategies accordingly. For businesses, understanding
			these trends allows them to better predict demand and optimize stock
			levels, reducing overstocking or understocking issues.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Consumer Loyalty and Long-Term Engagement</strong></p>
		<p>
			Loyalty programs and their long-term effects on consumer behavior
			remain critical components of a business’s strategy. While our data
			did not provide a direct measure of loyalty program participation,
			the trends observed suggest that loyal customers are likely to spend
			more over time, particularly in categories they prefer. This aligns
			with existing literature on the importance of loyalty in fostering
			repeat business. For companies, designing effective loyalty programs
			that reward frequent shoppers can lead to an increase in both the
			frequency and size of purchases.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Key Insights for Businesses</strong></p>
		<p>
			Our analysis offers several practical recommendations for businesses
			looking to optimize their strategies:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Tailor Promotions to Consumer Behavior:</strong> By
				understanding the seasonal and demographic factors influencing
				purchase behavior, businesses can design targeted promotions
				that encourage both small, frequent purchases and larger, less
				frequent ones.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Leverage Demographic Data:</strong> Demographic data,
				particularly gender and age, can be used to better target
				marketing campaigns. Males spend more overall, so targeted
				advertising in the right categories can drive higher sales.
				Additionally, the underrepresentation of younger consumers in
				the dataset suggests a potential market segment for digital and
				mobile-based marketing strategies.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Optimize Inventory Based on Seasonal Trends:</strong>
				The observed patterns in seasonal purchasing can help businesses
				predict product demand more accurately. Planning inventory for
				peak seasons and ensuring the right products are available at
				the right time is crucial.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Invest in Loyalty Programs:</strong> Given the long-term
				impact of loyalty on consumer spending, businesses should
				consider investing in or enhancing their loyalty programs.
				Providing rewards for frequent purchases, as well as
				personalized offers, can increase both purchase frequency and
				basket size.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Future Questions and Analysis</strong></p>
		<p>
			While this analysis offers significant insights into the factors
			influencing consumer buying behavior, there are several areas where
			further research could be beneficial:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Impact of Location on Purchase Behavior:</strong>
				Although the dataset provides basic demographic information, it
				lacks detailed geographic data that could reveal how location
				influences buying behavior. Future analysis could examine
				regional differences in product preferences, purchase frequency,
				and basket size. Mapping purchase behavior by geographic
				location could also provide insights into local trends and
				inform location-specific marketing strategies.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Effect of Online vs. In-Store Purchases:</strong>
				The dataset includes information on preferred shopping channels,
				but it does not differentiate between online and in-store
				purchases. A deeper dive into how these channels impact purchase
				behavior could be crucial. For example, do consumers purchase
				more when shopping online due to convenience, or do in-store
				promotions lead to higher basket sizes? Understanding the
				dynamics between these channels would help businesses better
				align their strategies for both online and physical stores.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>
					Analysis of Impulse Purchases and Basket Composition:
				</strong>
				Impulse buying behavior is often tied to promotions, but there
				may be additional factors at play. Future research could explore
				how product placement, limited-time offers, or even store layout
				contribute to impulse purchases. Additionally, analyzing basket
				composition (e.g., what types of products are often bought
				together) could reveal opportunities for cross-selling and
				bundling strategies.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>
					Longitudinal Analysis of Customer Loyalty Programs:
				</strong>
				While this study provides a snapshot of consumer behavior, a
				longitudinal analysis of customer loyalty programs would offer
				deeper insights into how these programs influence purchase
				behavior over time. Investigating customer retention rates, the
				impact of rewards on spending, and changes in basket size as a
				result of loyalty benefits could lead to more refined strategies
				for retaining high-value customers.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>
					Impact of Social Media and Digital Advertising on Purchases:
				</strong>
				With the increasing role of digital advertising and social media
				in shaping consumer behavior, future research could examine how
				these platforms influence the frequency and size of purchases.
				Do targeted social media ads or influencer partnerships lead to
				larger purchases, or do they primarily drive smaller, impulse
				buys? Understanding this relationship could help businesses
				optimize their digital marketing efforts.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Ethical Considerations and Consumer Privacy:</strong> As
				businesses increasingly rely on data analytics to understand
				consumer behavior, there are important ethical questions
				regarding data privacy and consumer consent. Future studies
				should address the ethical implications of data collection,
				ensuring that businesses balance personalization with consumer
				privacy rights. Analyzing consumer trust in data usage could
				also influence how businesses implement their marketing
				strategies.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In conclusion, while this analysis provides actionable insights for
			businesses to refine their marketing strategies, the evolving nature
			of consumer behavior and market conditions suggests that continued
			research is essential. Future studies will help businesses stay
			ahead of trends, improve customer experiences, and ultimately drive
			higher sales and long-term loyalty.
