		<p id="main">
			Understanding how purchase behavior is influenced by various factors
			such as location, promotions, demographics, and loyalty is crucial
			for businesses aiming to optimize their marketing and sales
			strategies. Our analysis seeks to examine how these elements impact
			both the frequency of purchases and the size of baskets, providing
			insights into consumer decision-making processes. By examining these
			factors, we can glean insights into how businesses can tailor their
			approaches to better meet the needs and preferences of their target
			audience, in order to drive sales and increase customer satisfaction
			and loyalty. Succinctly, the question weâ€™re looking to examine is:
			How is purchase behavior (frequency and basket size) impacted by
			buyer location, promotions, demographics, and loyalty?

		<p>
			For store owners, knowing the demographics for shopping behaviors
			and trends are important in order to target consumers for online and
			physical advertising. The chart shows the sales total purchase
			amounts for the primary genders, divided into the purchase
			categories. It can be seen that males spend nearly double overall
			than females, outspending them in every product category. However,
			for both males and females, the relative spending per category is
			the same, ie clothing is the largest category, followed by
			accessories, footwear, then outerwear. This suggests that males
			spend more overall when shopping, with the largest product category
			being clothing.
